# 🎭 Playwright Testing - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ What Was Created

I've created a **complete Playwright test suite** in `testing/playwright/` with **17 tests** for exactly the features you requested:

### 📋 Test Coverage

1. **Authentication (4 tests)** ✅
   - User Registration
   - Goal Setter Login
   - Buyer Login
   - Invalid Login Handling

2. **Goal Setter - Goals (3 tests)** ✅
   - Navigate to Goals Page
   - Create New Goal
   - Verify Goal in List

3. **Goal Setter - Wishlist (3 tests)** ✅
   - Navigate to Wishlist Page
   - Create Wishlist Item
   - Verify Wishlist Item

4. **Goal Setter - Marketplace (3 tests)** ✅
   - List Item on Marketplace
   - (Buyer) Browse Marketplace
   - (Buyer) View Product Details

5. **Buyer - Shopping Cart (4 tests)** ✅
   - Add Item to Cart
   - Navigate to Cart Page
   - View Cart Contents
   - Verify Checkout Button

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Install (2 minutes)

```bash
cd testing/playwright
npm install
npm run install-browsers
```

### Step 2: Configure (1 minute)

Edit `config.js` - Update these users:

```javascript
users: {
  goalSetter: {
    email: 'goalsetter@test.com',  // ← Your goal setter email
    password: 'Test@123',
    role: 'goal_setter'
  },
  buyer: {
    email: 'buyer@test.com',       // ← Your buyer email
    password: 'Test@123',
    role: 'buyer'
  }
}
```

**Important:** These users MUST exist in your app with correct roles!

### Step 3: Run Tests!

```bash
# Make sure your app is running first!
# Terminal 1: cd client && npm run dev
# Terminal 2: cd server && npm start

# Run all tests
npm test

# Or run with UI (recommended first time!)
npm run test:ui
```

## 📊 View Results

After tests finish:

```bash
npm run report
```

Opens a **beautiful HTML report** with:
- ✅ Pass/fail status
- 📸 Screenshots
- 🎥 Videos (on failures)
- ⏱️ Execution times
- 📝 Detailed logs

## 🎯 Why Playwright is Better

✅ **Auto-manages browsers** - No version conflicts
✅ **Faster** - Tests run quicker
✅ **Better errors** - Clear messages
✅ **Screenshots & Videos** - Automatic capture
✅ **Works on Windows** - Reliable on all platforms

```

## 🧪 Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Specific Test Files
```bash
npm run test:auth          # Authentication only
npm run test:goals         # Goals only
npm run test:wishlist      # Wishlist only
npm run test:marketplace   # Marketplace only
npm run test:cart          # Cart only
```

### Interactive UI Mode (Best!)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

This opens an interactive runner where you can:
- ✅ Pick which tests to run
- ✅ See browser in real-time
- ✅ Debug failures
- ✅ Replay tests

### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:debug
```

## 📸 Screenshots Generated

The tests automatically create screenshots:

- `goals-list.png` - Your goals page
- `wishlist-page.png` - Wishlist interface
- `wishlist-items.png` - Wishlist with items
- `marketplace-seller.png` - Seller view
- `marketplace-buyer.png` - Buyer view
- `product-details.png` - Product page
- `add-to-cart.png` - Adding to cart
- `cart-page.png` - Shopping cart
- `cart-contents.png` - Cart items
- `checkout-button.png` - Checkout screen

## ⚠️ Before Running

**Make sure:**

1. ✅ **Both servers running:**
   - Client: http://localhost:5173
   - Server: http://localhost:5000

2. ✅ **Test users exist:**
   - Create `goalsetter@test.com` with role "goal_setter"
   - Create `buyer@test.com` with role "buyer"
   - Password: `Test@123` for both

3. ✅ **Update config.js** if using different credentials

## 🎭 Test Modes

### Headless (Default)
```bash
npm test
```
- Browser runs in background
- Faster execution
- Good for CI/CD

### Headed (See Browser)
```bash
npm run test:headed
```
- Watch browser in action
- Good for debugging
- See exactly what happens

### UI Mode (Interactive)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```
- Best for development!
- Pick which tests to run
- Time-travel debugging
- Step-by-step execution

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail: "Navigation timeout"

**Solution:** Make sure both servers are running!
```bash
# Check these URLs in browser:
http://localhost:5173  # Should show your app
http://localhost:5000  # Should show API or error
```

### Tests Fail: "Login failed"

**Solution:** Check test users exist:
1. Register `goalsetter@test.com` with role "goal_setter"
2. Register `buyer@test.com` with role "buyer"
3. Update `config.js` if using different emails

### Error: "Browser not found"

**Solution:** Install browsers:
```bash
npm run install-browsers
```

### Tests Pass But Nothing Created

**This is normal!** Tests:
- ✅ Verify pages load
- ✅ Verify forms exist
- ✅ Verify buttons work

**Check screenshots** to see exactly what happened!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always run in UI mode first**: `npm run test:ui`
2. **Check screenshots**: They show exact state
3. **Run one file at a time**: `npm run test:auth`
4. **Update config.js**: Match your actual users
5. **Close other Chrome windows**: Avoid conflicts

## 🎉 Success Criteria

After running tests, you should see:

✅ **HTML Report** - Open with `npm run report`
✅ **Screenshots** - In `playwright-report/` folder
✅ **Pass/Fail Status** - For each test
✅ **Videos** - If any tests failed

Even if some tests fail, you'll get:
- 📸 Screenshots showing exactly what went wrong
- 📝 Error messages explaining the issue
- 🎥 Videos of failed test runs

## 🚀 What's Next?

1. **Run tests**: `npm run test:ui`
2. **View report**: Click "Show report" after tests
3. **Check screenshots**: See what happened
4. **Share results**: Show me the report or screenshots!
