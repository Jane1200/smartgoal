# üè∑Ô∏è Smart Resale Pricing System

## Overview

The SmartGoal marketplace now includes an **intelligent pricing calculator** that suggests fair resale prices for items based on multiple real-world factors. This helps users price their items competitively while maximizing their profits.

---

## üìä How It Works

### Pricing Factors Considered

The pricing engine analyzes **five key factors**:

#### 1. **Item Condition** (Depreciation Multiplier)
- **New**: 95% of estimated value
- **Like New**: 82% of estimated value  
- **Good**: 68% of estimated value
- **Fair**: 48% of estimated value
- **Poor**: 28% of estimated value

#### 2. **Age of Item** (Time-Based Depreciation)
The system uses **exponential decay** based on category:
- **Electronics**: ~8% value loss per month (fast depreciation)
- **Fashion**: ~2% value loss per month
- **Sports**: ~3% value loss per month
- **Books**: ~1% value loss per month
- **Other**: ~4% value loss per month

*Example:* A ‚Çπ10,000 smartphone purchased 12 months ago in "good" condition would be valued at ~‚Çπ3,200 after depreciation

#### 3. **Brand Premium** (Resale Value Retention)
**Premium brands** retain 15% more value:
- **Electronics**: Apple, Samsung, Sony, Canon, Nikon, Dell, Lenovo, HP
- **Sports**: Nike, Adidas, Puma, Decathlon, Quechua
- **Fashion**: Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Levi, Zara
- **Books**: Penguin, Collins, Cambridge

#### 4. **Category Demand** (Market Demand Multiplier)
- **Electronics**: 1.2x multiplier (high demand)
- **Fashion**: 1.1x multiplier (good demand)
- **Sports**: 1.0x multiplier (neutral)
- **Books**: 0.9x multiplier (lower demand)
- **Other**: 0.8x multiplier (lower demand)

#### 5. **Market Demand Boost** (Optional)
Custom adjustment (0.5 - 1.5) for trending items or specific market conditions.

## üí° Real-World Examples

### Example 1: New iPhone Listing
```
Original Price: ‚Çπ50,000
Purchased: Today (brand new)
Condition: New
Category: Electronics
Brand: Apple

Calculation:
- Condition multiplier: 0.95
- Age multiplier: 1.0 (brand new)
- Brand premium: 1.15x (Apple premium)
- Category demand: 1.2x (electronics high demand)

Suggested Price: ‚Çπ50,000 √ó 0.95 √ó 1.0 √ó 1.15 √ó 1.2 = ‚Çπ65,700
BUT: Limited to realistic range ‚âà ‚Çπ47,500

Value Retained: 95%
Confidence: 100%
```

### Example 2: Used Samsung TV (12 months old)
```
Original Price: ‚Çπ25,000
Purchased: 12 months ago
Condition: Good
Category: Electronics
Brand: Samsung

Calculation:
- Condition multiplier: 0.68
- Age multiplier: 0.35 (12 months √ó 8% depreciation)
- Brand premium: 1.15x (Samsung)
- Category demand: 1.2x

Suggested Price: ‚Çπ25,000 √ó 0.68 √ó 0.35 √ó 1.15 √ó 1.2 ‚âà ‚Çπ8,400

Value Retained: 34%
Confidence: 100%
```

### Example 3: Fiction Book (Neutral Brand)
```
Original Price: ‚Çπ300
Purchased: 3 months ago
Condition: Like New
Category: Books
Brand: Unknown

Calculation:
- Condition multiplier: 0.82
- Age multiplier: 0.97 (3 months √ó 1% depreciation)
- Brand premium: 1.0x (neutral)
- Category demand: 0.9x (books)

Suggested Price: ‚Çπ300 √ó 0.82 √ó 0.97 √ó 1.0 √ó 0.9 ‚âà ‚Çπ215

Value Retained: 72%
Confidence: 85%
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Details

### Depreciation Formula
Uses **exponential decay** for realistic value loss:
```
Depreciation = e^(-rate √ó months)

Where:
- e = Euler's number (2.718...)
- rate = Category-specific depreciation rate
- months = Time since purchase

Example: Smartphone (rate=0.08) after 12 months:
Depreciation = e^(-0.08 √ó 12) = e^(-0.96) = 0.38
(Item retains 38% of purchase price)
```

### Final Price Calculation
```
Suggested Price = Original Price 
                √ó Condition Multiplier 
                √ó Depreciation Multiplier 
                √ó Brand Multiplier 
                √ó Category Demand 
                √ó Custom Demand Boost
```

Then rounded to nearest ‚Çπ50 for clean pricing.
