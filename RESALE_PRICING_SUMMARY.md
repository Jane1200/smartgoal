## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Calculations Work

```javascript
// Simplified pseudocode
SuggestedPrice = OriginalPrice 
               × ConditionMultiplier      // 0.28 to 0.95
               × DepreciationMultiplier   // Based on age
               × BrandMultiplier          // 1.0 to 1.15
               × CategoryDemandMultiplier // 0.8 to 1.2
               
// Example: iPhone
₹75,000 × 0.82 × 0.64 × 1.15 × 1.2 = ₹54,300
```
