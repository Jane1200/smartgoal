# Buyer-Finance Connection & Goal Setter Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how the **Buyer Account** connects with the **Finance System** and its relationship with the **Goal Setter Account** in the SmartGoal application.

---

## 🔄 Connection Between Buyer and Goal Setter Accounts

### Same User, Different Roles
In SmartGoal, a **single user** can have **two roles**:

1. **Goal Setter Role** (`goal_setter`)
   - Focus: Setting financial goals, tracking savings, managing finances
   - Pages: Goals, Finances, Marketplace (selling), Analytics
   - Activities: Create goals, track income/expenses, list items for sale

2. **Buyer Role** (`buyer`)
   - Focus: Purchasing items from the marketplace
   - Pages: Browse Marketplace, Cart, Orders, Finances
   - Activities: Shop, buy items, track orders, manage finances

### Role Switching
Users can **seamlessly switch** between roles using the role switcher in the header dropdown:
- **Goal Setter** → Buyer: When you want to purchase items
- **Buyer** → Goal Setter: When you want to manage your financial goals

**Key Point**: Both roles **share the same finance data** (income, expenses, savings) because they belong to the same user account.

## 💰 How Finance Integration Works for Buyers

### 1. Finance Access for Buyers

#### Navigation
Buyers now have access to the **"My Finances"** page via:
- **Sidebar**: `My Finances` link in the buyer dashboard sidebar
- **Route**: `/buyer-finances`

#### Same Finance Data, Shared Across Roles
Whether you're in Goal Setter mode or Buyer mode:
- ✅ Income entries are **shared**
- ✅ Expense entries are **shared**
- ✅ Savings calculations are **shared**
- ✅ Finance summary is **synchronized in real-time**

### 2. Available Savings Display

#### Buyer Dashboard Finance Card
The Buyer Dashboard now prominently displays an **"Available Savings"** card showing:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💰 Available Savings               │
│                                     │
│  ₹ 25,000                          │
│  Your current purchasing power      │
│                                     │
│  ℹ️ Before you purchase:           │
│  You can only buy items if you     │
│  have sufficient savings.          │
│                                     │
│  ✓ You have ₹25,000 available     │
│    for purchases                    │
│                                     │
│  [View Details →]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Calculation**:
- Available Savings = Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- Displayed prominently to inform purchasing decisions

### 3. Purchase Validation with Finance Check

#### Before Checkout
When a buyer proceeds to checkout, the system validates:

```javascript
// Backend validation in orders.js
const totalAmount = cart.totalAmount;
const savingsCheck = await checkSufficientSavings(userId, totalAmount);

if (!savingsCheck.hasSufficient) {
  return {
    success: false,
    message: "Insufficient savings to complete this purchase",
    details: {
      requiredAmount: totalAmount,
      availableSavings: savingsCheck.availableSavings,
      shortfall: savingsCheck.shortfall
    }
  }
}
```

#### Validation Rules

**Full Payment**:
- ✅ Available Savings ≥ Total Purchase Amount
- ❌ Blocks purchase if insufficient savings
- 📧 Creates notification explaining shortfall

**EMI Payment**:
- ✅ Average Monthly Savings ≥ Monthly Installment Amount
- ⚠️ Warns if monthly savings may not cover installments
- 📊 Shows projected savings over EMI period

**Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)**:
- ✅ Must have sufficient savings within 14 days
- ⚠️ Warns about payment due date after delivery
