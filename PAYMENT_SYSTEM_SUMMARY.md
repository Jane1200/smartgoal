## 📊 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Student Selling Old Books, Buying New Laptop

```
Initial Balance: ₹5,000

Step 1: SELL old textbooks for ₹3,000
  → MarketplaceIncome: +₹3,000
  → Finance: income +₹3,000
  → Balance: ₹5,000 → ₹8,000 ✅

Step 2: BUY laptop for ₹15,000 (3-month EMI)
  → PaymentPlan created: 3 × ₹5,000
  → Month 1: -₹5,000 → Balance: ₹3,000
  → Month 2: -₹5,000 → Balance: -₹2,000 (need more income!)
  
Lesson: Plan EMI payments based on expected income!
```

### Example 2: Seller with Regular Sales

```
Initial Balance: ₹10,000

Month 1:
  SELL: Watch (₹5,000) → Balance: ₹15,000
  BUY: Shoes (₹2,000 full) → Balance: ₹13,000
  
Month 2:
  SELL: Camera (₹20,000) → Balance: ₹33,000
  BUY: Phone (₹18,000 split: 50%-50%)
    → Immediate: -₹9,000 → Balance: ₹24,000
    → Deferred (30 days later): -₹9,000 → Balance: ₹15,000

Final Balance: ₹15,000
Net: Sold ₹25K, Spent ₹20K = +₹5K profit ✅
```

### Example 3: First-Time Buyer (Building Trust)

```
Initial Balance: ₹8,000

Step 1: BUY item for ₹3,000 (BNPL)
  → Day 0: Balance unchanged (₹8,000)
  → Day 7: Item delivered (₹8,000)
  → Day 14: Payment deducted → Balance: ₹5,000
  
Benefit: User got item immediately, paid later ✅
Risk: Lower (only ₹3K, not ₹30K)
```

## 💬 Questions & Answers

**Q: Will user's balance go negative?**
A: Only if they don't have enough income. Add validation to check balance before allowing purchases.

**Q: Can user cancel order after choosing EMI?**
A: Yes, but refund logic needs to be implemented for paid installments.

**Q: What if user misses EMI payment?**
A: Current system doesn't auto-charge. You need to add:
- Payment reminders
- Auto-deduction (if enabled)
- Late fee logic (optional)

**Q: Can user be both buyer and seller in same order?**
A: No, that wouldn't make sense. But same user can sell one item and buy another item - that works perfectly!

**Q: How to prevent users from buying without income?**
A: Add balance check before checkout:
```javascript
const userBalance = await getUserBalance(userId);
if (userBalance < cartTotal) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    message: "Insufficient balance. Please add income first." 
  });
}
```
