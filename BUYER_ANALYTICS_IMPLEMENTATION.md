calculateCategoryBreakdown(orders) {
  // Groups orders by item category
  // Sums total spending per category
  // Returns sorted array by spending amount
}
```

#### Monthly Trends
```javascript
calculateMonthlyTrends(orders) {
  // Analyzes last 6 months
  // Aggregates spending and order count per month
  // Returns chronological data for charts
}
```

#### Order Status
```javascript
calculateOrderStatus(orders) {
  // Counts orders by status
  // Returns distribution data
}
```

#### Payment Methods
```javascript
calculatePaymentMethods(orders) {
  // Analyzes payment method usage
  // Maps method codes to display names
  // Returns usage distribution
}
```

#### Top Purchases
```javascript
getTopPurchases(orders) {
  // Extracts all items from orders
  // Sorts by price (highest first)
  // Returns top 5 items
}
```

#### Spending vs Savings
```javascript
calculateSpendingVsSavings(financeData, stats) {
  // Compares income, spending, and savings
  // Returns three-way comparison data
}
```

}
```

Only users with `buyer` role can access this analytics page.

### Navigation
Users can access the analytics page via:
1. Buyer sidebar navigation → "Analytics"
2. Direct URL: `/buyer-analytics`

## Key Differences from Goal Setter Analytics

| Feature | Goal Setter Analytics | Buyer Analytics |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Focus** | Goals, savings, marketplace sales | Purchases, spending, order history |
| **Income Source** | Multiple sources + marketplace | Finance tracking only |
| **Primary Metrics** | Goal progress, savings rate, items sold | Total spent, orders, avg order value |
| **Charts** | Goal progress, income sources, expense categories | Purchase categories, monthly trends, payment methods |
| **Insights** | Goal completion, marketplace performance | Spending patterns, purchase behavior |
| **Recommendations** | Income diversification, goal strategies | Spending control, budget management |

## Chart Configurations

### Color Palette
```javascript
const COLORS = [
  "#0d6efd", // Blue
  "#198754", // Green
  "#ffc107", // Yellow
  "#dc3545", // Red
  "#6c757d", // Gray
  "#0dcaf0", // Cyan
  "#6610f2", // Purple
  "#d63384"  // Pink
];
```

### Chart Library
- **Recharts** - React charting library
- Responsive containers
- Interactive tooltips
- Custom formatting for currency (₹)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features:
1. **Date Range Filters**: Allow users to select custom date ranges
2. **Export Data**: Download analytics as PDF/CSV
3. **Spending Predictions**: ML-based spending forecasts
4. **Budget Alerts**: Real-time notifications for budget limits
5. **Comparison Views**: Compare spending across different time periods
6. **Category Goals**: Set spending limits per category
7. **Savings Goals Integration**: Link purchases to savings targets
8. **Wishlist Analytics**: Track wishlist conversion rates

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Page loads without errors for buyer role
- [ ] Redirects non-buyer roles correctly
- [ ] All metrics display correct values
- [ ] Charts render properly with data
- [ ] Charts show placeholder when no data
- [ ] Top purchases table displays correctly
- [ ] Insights are contextual to user data
- [ ] Recommendations are relevant
- [ ] Navigation link is active when on page
- [ ] Responsive on mobile devices

### Test Scenarios:
1. **New Buyer (No Orders)**: Should show placeholder messages
2. **Buyer with Few Orders**: Should display basic analytics
3. **Active Buyer (Many Orders)**: Should show comprehensive insights
4. **Buyer with No Savings**: Should show warning recommendations
5. **Buyer with High Savings**: Should show positive reinforcement

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Implemented:
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Error handling with try-catch
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Promise.allSettled for concurrent API calls
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessible UI components
- ✅ Modular calculation functions
- ✅ Clear variable naming
- ✅ Comments for complex logic

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques:
1. **Concurrent API Calls**: Using `Promise.allSettled`
2. **Client-side Calculations**: Reducing server load
3. **Data Memoization**: Calculations done once per fetch
4. **Chart Lazy Loading**: Charts render only when data available

## Security

### Protected Routes:
- Route wrapped in `RequireAuth` and `RequireBuyer`
- Backend API calls require authentication tokens
- User can only see their own data

## Documentation

### Component Props:
None - Component uses hooks for data fetching

### State Management:
```javascript
const [analytics, setAnalytics] = useState({
  overview: { ... },
  categoryBreakdown: [],
  monthlyTrends: [],
  orderStatus: [],
  paymentMethods: [],
  topPurchases: [],
  spendingVsSavings: []
});
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
```

### Hooks Used:
- `useState` - Component state management
- `useEffect` - Data fetching on mount
- `useAuth` - Authentication context
- `Navigate` - Role-based redirection

## Deployment Notes

### Dependencies:
All required dependencies already installed:
- `react-router-dom` - Routing
- `recharts` - Charts
- `react-toastify` - Error notifications
- `axios` (via api.js) - HTTP requests

### No Migration Required:
- No database changes needed
- Frontend-only feature
- Uses existing API endpoints

## Support

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: Charts not displaying
- **Solution**: Ensure orders exist and contain valid data

**Issue**: 404 on route
- **Solution**: Verify route added to `App.jsx` and server routing configured

**Issue**: "No data available" messages
- **Solution**: Normal for new users with no purchase history

**Issue**: Incorrect metrics
- **Solution**: Check order data structure matches expected format

## Summary

The Buyer Analytics page provides a comprehensive, visual overview of buyer spending behavior and purchase patterns. It is:
- ✅ **Completely separate** from goal setter analytics
- ✅ **Buyer-focused** with relevant metrics
- ✅ **Visually rich** with multiple chart types
- ✅ **Insightful** with smart recommendations
- ✅ **Easy to use** with intuitive navigation
- ✅ **Secure** with role-based access control
