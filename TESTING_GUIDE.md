## üîç Server Log Patterns

### ‚úÖ Success Pattern
```
Static scrape error: Request failed with status code 403
[Scraper] Using Playwright for https://www.nykaa.com/...
[Playwright] Navigating to https://www.nykaa.com/... with waitUntil="load", timeout=60000ms
[Playwright] Navigation successful, status: 200
[Scraper Debug] www.nykaa.com: { hasTitle: true, hasPrice: true, hasImage: true, ... }
[Scraper] Successfully extracted product data via Playwright
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success Pattern
```
[Playwright] Navigation successful, status: 200
[Scraper Debug] www.nykaa.com: { hasTitle: true, hasPrice: false, hasImage: true, ... }
[Scraper] Playwright succeeded but data is sparse
```
**Result**: Some fields populated, user can edit missing ones

### ‚ùå HTTP/2 Error Pattern (With Fallback)
```
[Playwright] Navigation error: net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR
[Playwright] Detected HTTP/2 error, trying with HTTP/1.1 fallback...
[Playwright] HTTP/1.1 fallback successful, status: 200
[Scraper Debug] www.nykaa.com: { hasTitle: true, hasPrice: true, ... }
```
**Result**: Fallback worked, data extracted

### ‚ùå Complete Failure Pattern
```
[Playwright] Navigation error: net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR
[Playwright] Detected HTTP/2 error, trying with HTTP/1.1 fallback...
[Playwright] HTTP/1.1 fallback also failed: ...
[Scraper Debug] www.nykaa.com: { hasTitle: false, hasPrice: false, ... }
[Scraper] Playwright succeeded but data is sparse
```
**Result**: Manual entry required

## üì∏ Screenshots to Share

- Screenshot of error message
- Include any toast notifications

### 3. Server Logs
- Copy/paste the complete server console output

## üêõ Debugging Tools

### Visual Debug Script
See exactly what Playwright is doing:
```bash
cd server
node test-nykaa-scrape.js
```

**What it does:**
- Opens visible browser window (not headless)
- Shows which selectors find data
- Displays extracted information
- Lets you inspect the page

### Server Logs
Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// Already enabled in the code
console.log(`[Playwright] ...`);
console.log(`[Scraper Debug] ...`);
```

### Browser DevTools
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any JavaScript errors
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

## üìã Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

- [ ] Server is running (`npm run dev` in server folder)
- [ ] No errors in server startup logs
- [ ] Playwright is installed (`npx playwright install chromium`)
- [ ] Using correct URL format (https://...)
- [ ] Waited full 30 seconds for Nykaa/Myntra
- [ ] Checked server console for detailed logs
- [ ] Tried with different product URL

## üîÑ Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "It's taking too long"
**Expected**: Nykaa/Myntra take 20-30 seconds
**Action**: Wait patiently, watch server logs

### Scenario 2: "Got empty fields"
**Expected**: Some sites are harder to scrape
**Action**: Edit fields manually, all fields are editable

### Scenario 3: "HTTP/2 error in logs"
**Expected**: Fallback should trigger automatically
**Action**: Check if fallback succeeded in next log line

### Scenario 4: "403 Forbidden error"
**Expected**: Normal for static scrape, Playwright should follow
**Action**: Wait for Playwright fallback to complete

### Scenario 5: "Chromium not found"
**Action**: Run `npx playwright install chromium`

- Wait between tests
- Avoid testing same URL repeatedly
- Sites may block your IP

### 4. Use Manual Entry as Backup
- Always available
- More reliable
- Faster for known products
