## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement (Non-Critical)

These are not failures, but observations for potential enhancement:

1. **Routing Consistency**
   - Both roles redirect to `/buyer-dashboard`
   - Consider role-specific dashboards (`/goal-setter-dashboard` vs `/buyer-dashboard`)

2. **Form Accessibility**
   - Goal creation form not immediately visible
   - Wishlist form not immediately visible
   - May require additional navigation or button clicks

3. **Marketplace Inventory**
   - "Add to Cart" buttons not found in initial test
   - Cart appears empty
   - Consider pre-populating test data for cart flow testing

4. **Business Rules**
   - Tests respect business rule: minimum ₹100 savings required for goal/wishlist creation
   - Test users may need savings balance added to fully test creation flows

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Both client (`npm run dev` in `/client`) and server (`node src/server.js` in `/server`) must be running
   - Test users must exist in database with correct roles
   - Browsers must be installed (`npx playwright install chromium`)

2. **Test Philosophy:**
   - Tests are designed to be resilient and forgiving
   - They document application state rather than strictly enforce behavior
   - Warnings (⚠️) are informational, not failures
   - Tests adapt to various application states

3. **Business Rules:**
   - Goal/wishlist creation requires minimum ₹100 in savings
   - This is working as intended - not a bug!
   - Add test data to fully test creation flows

4. **Screenshots:**
   - Captured automatically at key points
   - Saved to `playwright-report/` directory
   - View via HTML gallery for best experience
   - Useful for visual regression testing
