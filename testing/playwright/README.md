## 📝 Understanding Results

### Test Outcomes

**✅ PASSED**: Test completed successfully
- User logged in
- Page loaded
- Action completed
- Expected state reached

**⚠️  SKIPPED/GRACEFUL**: Test handled edge case
- Form not available (may require setup)
- Insufficient savings (business rule working correctly)
- Empty state (expected if no data)

**❌ FAILED**: Test encountered error
- Login failed (check credentials)
- Page didn't load
- Timeout occurred
- Unexpected error

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Still on login page"
- ❌ **Cause**: Incorrect credentials
- ✅ **Fix**: Update `config.js` with correct user emails/passwords

#### "Form not visible"
- ⚠️  **Cause**: Different app state or navigation required
- ✅ **Fix**: Check if user needs to navigate differently

#### "Insufficient savings"
- ✅ **Expected**: Business rule validation working!
- ℹ️  **Note**: Add savings to test user to test goal creation

#### "Servers not running"
- ❌ **Cause**: Client or API server not started
- ✅ **Fix**: Start both servers before running tests

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.js -g "Goal Setter Login"
