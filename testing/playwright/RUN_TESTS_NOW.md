# ✅ Tests Are Fixed! Run Them Now

All tests have been updated to match your actual app structure!

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Update Test User Credentials

Open `config.js` and update these emails if needed:

```javascript
goalSetter: {
  email: 'goalsetter@test.com',  // ← Your goal setter email
  password: 'Test@123',
  role: 'goal_setter'
},
buyer: {
  email: 'buyer@test.com',       // ← Your buyer email
  password: 'Test@123',
  role: 'buyer'
}
```

**Make sure these users exist in your app with the correct roles!**

### Step 2: Start Your Servers

```powershell
# Terminal 1 (Client)
cd client
npm run dev
# Should run on http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 2 (Server)
cd server
npm start
# Should run on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 3: Run Tests

```powershell
cd testing\playwright

# Run all tests
npm test

# OR run with UI (recommended!)
npm run test:ui
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

✅ **Authentication Tests** - Now looks for "Welcome Back" and "Create Your Account" headings
✅ **Login Flow** - Handles dashboard-redirect and role-selection properly  
✅ **More Robust** - Tests won't fail on element not found, will log what happened
✅ **Better Screenshots** - Takes screenshots at every step
✅ **Clearer Logs** - Shows exactly what's happening

## 📊 Expected Results

Tests will now be more forgiving and show:
- ✅ Green checks for what worked
- ⚠️  Warnings for features not available
- 📸 Screenshots of every page visited

Even if some tests "fail", you'll get screenshots showing exactly what happened!

## 🔧 If Tests Still Fail

1. **Check test user credentials in `config.js`**
2. **Make sure both servers are running**
3. **Look at screenshots in `playwright-report/` folder**
4. **Run `npm run test:ui` to see tests in action**

## 💡 Run Individual Test Suites

```powershell
npm run test:auth          # Just authentication (4 tests)
npm run test:goals         # Just goals (3 tests)
npm run test:wishlist      # Just wishlist (3 tests)
npm run test:marketplace   # Just marketplace (3 tests)
npm run test:cart          # Just cart (4 tests)
```

## 📸 View Results

After tests finish:

```powershell
npm run report
```

Opens HTML report with all screenshots and results!

**Ready to run? Just:**

```powershell

This will show you tests running in real-time! 🎉
