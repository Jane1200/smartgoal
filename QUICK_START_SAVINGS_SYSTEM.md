# Quick Start - Savings-Based System

## 🎯 What Changed?

**OLD SYSTEM:**
- ✅ User sells item → Income increases
- ❌ User buys item → Deducts directly from income (no validation)

**NEW SYSTEM:**
- ✅ User sells item → Income increases
- ✅ User buys item → **Validates savings first**, then deducts
- ✅ User allocates to goals → **Validates savings first**, then allocates
- ✅ Notifications sent if insufficient savings

---

## 💰 Savings Formula

```
SAVINGS = Total Income - Total Expenses

Example:
Income:    ₹50,000 (salary + marketplace sales)
Expenses:  ₹20,000 (rent + food + transport)
─────────────────────
SAVINGS:   ₹30,000  ← This is what you can spend
```

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Backend Utility Functions
**File:** `server/src/utils/financeUtils.js`

- `calculateUserSavings(userId)` - Calculate total savings
- `checkSufficientSavings(userId, amount)` - Validate savings
- `calculateProjectedSavingsWithEMI(...)` - Check EMI affordability

### 2. ✅ Purchase Validation
**File:** `server/src/routes/orders.js`

- **Full Payment:** Checks if user has enough savings
- **EMI:** Checks if monthly installments are affordable
- **BNPL:** Checks if user will have enough savings later
- **Split:** Checks if user has enough for upfront payment

### 3. ✅ Goal Allocation Validation
**File:** `server/src/routes/goals.js`

- Validates savings before allocating to goals
- Blocks allocation if insufficient savings

### 4. ✅ Notification System
**Files:** 
- `server/src/models/Notification.js` - Notification model
- `server/src/routes/notifications.js` - Notification routes

Types of notifications:
- Purchase blocked due to insufficient savings
- Goal allocation blocked
- EMI not affordable warning

### 5. ✅ New API Endpoints

```bash
# Get savings
GET /api/finance/savings

# Get savings breakdown
GET /api/finance/savings/breakdown

# Get notifications
GET /api/notifications

# Get unread count
GET /api/notifications/unread-count
```

}
```

### Test 2: Try Purchase With Insufficient Savings

```bash
# Setup

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Insufficient savings to complete this purchase",
  "error": "INSUFFICIENT_SAVINGS",
  "details": {
    "requiredAmount": 20000,
    "availableSavings": 5000,
    "shortfall": 15000
  },
  "notification": {
    "type": "error",
    "title": "Insufficient Savings",
    "message": "You need ₹20,000 but only have ₹5,000 in savings..."
  }
}
```

### Test 3: Try Purchase With Sufficient Savings

## 🔍 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Insufficient savings to complete this purchase"

**Cause:** User's savings (income - expenses) is less than purchase amount

**Solution:**
1. Add more income to Finance
2. OR reduce/remove some expenses
3. OR choose a different payment plan (EMI with smaller installments)

### Error: "Your projected savings may not support this EMI plan"

**Cause:** User's average monthly savings is less than monthly EMI amount

**Solution:**
1. Choose longer EMI period (e.g., 12 months instead of 3)
2. OR save more money before purchasing
3. OR reduce the purchase amount

### Error: "Insufficient savings to allocate to goals"

**Cause:** User trying to allocate more than available savings to goals

## 📊 Frontend Implementation Examples

### Display Savings on Dashboard

```jsx
const [savings, setSavings] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/finance/savings', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setSavings(data.savings));
}, []);

return (
  <div className="savings-card">
    <h3>Available Savings</h3>
    <h2>₹{savings?.totalSavings.toLocaleString()}</h2>
    <p>Income: ₹{savings?.totalIncome.toLocaleString()}</p>
    <p>Expenses: ₹{savings?.totalExpenses.toLocaleString()}</p>
  </div>
);
```

### Handle Checkout Error

```jsx
const handleCheckout = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/orders/checkout', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ /* checkout data */ })
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok) {
      if (data.error === 'INSUFFICIENT_SAVINGS') {
        // Show alert
        alert(`Insufficient Savings!\n\n` +
              `Required: ₹${data.details.requiredAmount.toLocaleString()}\n` +
              `Available: ₹${data.details.availableSavings.toLocaleString()}\n` +
              `Shortfall: ₹${data.details.shortfall.toLocaleString()}\n\n` +
              `Please add ₹${data.details.shortfall.toLocaleString()} more to your savings.`);
        
        // Redirect to finances
        if (confirm('Go to Finances page to add income?')) {
          navigate('/finances');
        }
        return;
      }
    }

    // Success
    alert('Order placed successfully!');
    navigate('/orders');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Checkout error:', error);
  }
};
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### 1. **Savings ≠ Income**
- Income is what you earn
- Savings is what's left after expenses
- You can only spend from savings, not income

### 2. **All Spending Requires Savings**
- Purchases deduct from savings
- Goal allocations deduct from savings
- If savings = 0, you cannot spend

### 3. **EMI Checks Future Affordability**
- Looks at average monthly savings (last 3 months)
- Compares to monthly installment amount
- Projects future savings for each month
- Blocks EMI if any month shows negative savings

### 4. **Notifications Keep Users Informed**
- Created automatically when actions are blocked
- Stored in database
- Can be viewed in notification center
- Include actionable links (e.g., "Add Income")

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Q: User has income but cannot purchase?**
A: Check if expenses are too high. Savings = Income - Expenses.

**Q: Marketplace income not counting?**
A: Marketplace income is included in totalIncome. Verify Finance entry was created.

**Q: EMI blocked even though user has money?**
A: EMI checks AVERAGE monthly savings (last 3 months), not current savings.

**Q: How to increase savings?**
A: Either add more income OR reduce expenses.

**Q: Can user purchase with negative savings?**
A: No, savings are capped at minimum 0. User must add income first.
