# Nykaa Scraping Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
When you tried to scrape the Nykaa URL, the server returned:
```
Static scrape error: Request failed with status code 403
```

This means **Nykaa is blocking automated requests** with a 403 Forbidden error.

## Root Cause
1. **403 Forbidden**: Nykaa has strong anti-bot protection that blocks simple HTTP requests
2. **Playwright fallback not working optimally**: The fallback to Playwright was triggered, but the selectors weren't flexible enough to extract data from Nykaa's dynamic CSS class names

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Anti-Bot Protection in Playwright**
- ✅ Added `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` flag
- ✅ Enhanced stealth scripts to hide automation markers
- ✅ Added realistic browser headers
- ✅ Disabled resource blocking for Nykaa (loads images/CSS to appear more human)
- ✅ Increased wait times for JavaScript-heavy sites (2-3.5 seconds for Nykaa)
- ✅ Changed `waitUntil` to `networkidle` for better page load detection

### 2. **More Flexible CSS Selectors for Nykaa**

#### Title Selectors:
```javascript
'h1[class*="css"]'           // Matches any h1 with "css" in class name
'h1'                         // Fallback to any h1
'[class*="product-title"]'   // Generic product title
'[class*="ProductTitle"]'    // Capitalized variant
```

#### Price Selectors:
```javascript
'[class*="css"][class*="price"]'  // CSS classes with "price"
'[class*="final"]'                // Final price
'[class*="selling"]'              // Selling price
'span[class*="css"]'              // Any span with CSS class
```

#### Image Selectors:
```javascript
'img[class*="css"]'          // Any image with CSS class
'[class*="image"] img'       // Images in containers with "image"
'img[alt*="product"]'        // Images with "product" in alt text
```

### 3. **Better Error Logging**
Added debug logging to see what's being extracted:
```javascript
[Scraper Debug] www.nykaa.com: {
  hasTitle: true/false,
  hasPrice: true/false,
  hasImage: true/false,
  hasDescription: true/false,
  titleLength: X,
  descLength: Y
}
```

## Testing

### Option 1: Test via the UI (Recommended)
1. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Try the Nykaa URL again**:
   ```
   https://www.nykaa.com/dot-key-vitamin-c-e-super-bright-moisturizer/p/2793280?productId=2793282&skuId=2793280&pps=1
   ```

3. **Wait patiently**: It may take 15-20 seconds for Playwright to:
   - Launch the browser
   - Navigate to the page
   - Wait for JavaScript to render
   - Extract the data

4. **Check server logs** for debug output

### Option 2: Test with Debug Script
I created a test script to help debug the scraping:

```bash
cd server
node test-nykaa-scrape.js
```

This will:
- Open a visible browser window (not headless)
- Navigate to the Nykaa product page
- Try each selector and show what it finds
- Keep the browser open so you can inspect the page

## Expected Behavior

### If Successful:
- ✅ Title extracted
- ✅ Price extracted
- ✅ Image URL extracted
- ✅ Description extracted (from meta tags)
- ✅ Category set to "Fashion"
- ✅ Brand extracted

### If Still Failing:
Nykaa may still block the request if:
- Their anti-bot protection is very sophisticated
- They detect Playwright/Chromium
- Your IP is rate-limited

## Fallback Options

If Nykaa continues to block scraping:

### Option 1: Manual Entry
Users can manually fill in the product details:
- Title
- Price
- Image URL (copy from browser)
- Description

### Option 2: Browser Extension (Future Enhancement)
Create a browser extension that:
- Runs in the user's actual browser
- Extracts product details from the current page
- Sends data to your app
- Cannot be blocked (runs in real browser)

### Option 3: Use Nykaa API (If Available)
- Check if Nykaa offers a product API
- Requires partnership/API key
- More reliable but may have costs

## Why Nykaa is Harder to Scrape

1. **Dynamic CSS Classes**: Nykaa uses CSS-in-JS with generated class names like `css-1gc4w7j` that change frequently
2. **JavaScript-Heavy**: The entire page is rendered with React/JavaScript
3. **Anti-Bot Protection**: Sophisticated detection of automated browsers
4. **Rate Limiting**: May block repeated requests from same IP

## Next Steps

1. **Test the updated scraper** with the Nykaa URL
2. **Check server logs** for debug output
3. **Share the logs** if it still doesn't work
4. **Consider alternatives** if Nykaa continues to block

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Scraping Limitations**:
- Web scraping may violate Nykaa's Terms of Service
- They have the right to block automated access
- Consider using official APIs when available
- Always respect robots.txt and rate limits

✅ **What Works Well**:
- Amazon: Good structured data, easy to scrape
- Flipkart: Good structured data, easy to scrape
- Myntra: Similar to Nykaa but slightly easier
- Nykaa: Challenging due to anti-bot protection

## Debugging Checklist

If scraping still fails, check:

- [ ] Is Playwright installed? (`npx playwright install chromium`)
- [ ] Is the server running? (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Are there errors in server console?
- [ ] Are there errors in browser console (F12)?
- [ ] Does the URL work in a regular browser?
- [ ] Is your internet connection stable?
- [ ] Try a different Nykaa product URL
- [ ] Check if Nykaa's website structure changed
