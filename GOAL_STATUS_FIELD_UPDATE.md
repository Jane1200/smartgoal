# Goal Status Field Update

## What Changed

The **Status** field has been removed from the goal creation form. Users can now only set the status when **editing** an existing goal.

## Implementation

### File Modified: `client/src/sections/GoalsManager.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. Status field is now conditionally rendered only when editing (`isEdit === true`)
2. When creating a new goal, status is automatically set to **"planned"** (default)
3. Due Date field now takes full width when creating, half width when editing

### Before ❌
```
Create Goal Form:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title: [________________]       │
│ Description: [__________]       │
│ Category: [v Dropdown]          │
│ Target Amount: [________]       │
│ Due Date: [____]  Status: [v]   │
│                                 │
│ [Create Goal]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After ✅
```
Create Goal Form:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title: [________________]       │
│ Description: [__________]       │
│ Category: [v Dropdown]          │
│ Target Amount: [________]       │
│ Due Date: [___________________] │
│                                 │
│ [Create Goal]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Edit Goal Form:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title: [________________]       │
│ Description: [__________]       │
│ Category: [v Dropdown]          │
│ Target Amount: [________]       │
│ Due Date: [____]  Status: [v]   │
│                                 │
│ [Update Goal]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Default Behavior

**When Creating a Goal:**
- Status is automatically set to **"planned"**
- Users cannot choose status during creation
- Cleaner, simpler form

**When Editing a Goal:**
- Status field appears alongside Due Date
- Users can change status to:
  - `planned` - Goal is planned
  - `in_progress` - Actively working on it
  - `completed` - Goal achieved
  - `archived` - No longer active

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler Creation** - Less fields to fill when creating  
✅ **Logical Flow** - Status changes as goal progresses  
✅ **Less Confusion** - New users don't need to choose status upfront  
✅ **Better UX** - Due Date field has more space when creating  
✅ **Automatic Status** - Always starts as "planned"  

## User Flow

### Creating a New Goal
```
1. User clicks "Create New Goal"
2. Fills in: Title, Description, Category, Target Amount, Due Date
3. Status is automatically "planned" (hidden)
4. Clicks "Create Goal"
5. Goal created with status = "planned" ✓
```

### Editing a Goal
```
1. User clicks "Edit" on existing goal
2. Form shows all fields including Status
3. User can change status:
   - "In Progress" when starting to save
   - "Completed" when target reached
   - "Archived" if no longer pursuing
4. Clicks "Update Goal"
5. Goal updated with new status ✓
```

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Conditional Rendering:**
```jsx
<div className={isEdit ? "col" : "col-12"}>
  <label>Due Date</label>
  <input type="date" ... />
</div>
{isEdit && (
  <div className="col">
    <label>Status</label>
    <select value={form.status} ...>
      <option value="planned">Planned</option>
      <option value="in_progress">In Progress</option>
      <option value="completed">Completed</option>
      <option value="archived">Archived</option>
    </select>
  </div>
)}
```

**Default Status:**
```javascript
const emptyForm = {
  title: "",
  description: "",
  targetAmount: "",
  dueDate: "",
  status: "planned",  // Always "planned" for new goals
  category: "other",
  priority: 3,
};
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Create New Goal
**Steps:**
1. Click "Create New Goal"
2. Fill in Title: "Emergency Fund"
3. Select Category: "Emergency Fund"
4. Enter Target Amount: 50000
5. Select Due Date: Future date
6. Click "Create Goal"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Goal created successfully
- ✅ Status is "planned" (automatic)
- ✅ Status field was not visible during creation

### Test Case 2: Edit Existing Goal
**Steps:**
1. Click "Edit" on an existing goal
2. Status field appears
3. Change status from "planned" to "in_progress"
4. Click "Update Goal"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Goal updated successfully
- ✅ Status changed to "in_progress"
- ✅ Status field was visible during edit

### Test Case 3: Status Workflow
**Steps:**
1. Create goal → Status: "planned" (auto)
2. Start saving → Edit → Status: "in_progress"
3. Reach target → Edit → Status: "completed"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Natural progression from planned → in progress → completed

## Status Lifecycle

```
New Goal Created
      ↓
  [planned] ← Automatic (hidden during creation)
      ↓
  User starts saving
      ↓
[in_progress] ← User manually changes (visible in edit)
      ↓
  Goal target reached
      ↓
 [completed] ← User manually changes (visible in edit)
```

## Migration Notes

- **Existing Goals:** No changes, all statuses remain as-is
- **New Goals:** Will always start with "planned" status
- **No Database Changes:** Backend still accepts all status values
- **Backward Compatible:** Fully compatible with existing system

## Summary

✅ **Status field removed from goal creation form**  
✅ **Status field available only when editing goals**  
✅ **Default status is "planned" for all new goals**  
✅ **Due Date field gets more space during creation**  
✅ **Better user experience with simpler form**  

Users now have a cleaner goal creation experience! 🎯
