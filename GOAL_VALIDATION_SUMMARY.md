# ✅ Goal Form Validation - Implementation Complete

## What Was Done

Comprehensive field-by-field validation has been added to the goal creation/editing form with real-time feedback and helpful error messages.

## Changes Made

**File Modified:** `client/src/sections/GoalsManager.jsx`

### 1. Enhanced Submit Validation
- Added category validation (was missing)
- Improved error messaging (single vs multiple errors)
- Better user feedback

### 2. Real-Time Validation (OnBlur)
All fields now validate when user leaves the field:
- **Title:** Min 3, max 100 characters, valid format
- **Description:** Max 500 characters (if provided)
- **Target Amount:** Min ₹100, max ₹1,00,00,000
- **Due Date:** Must be today or future

### 3. Auto Error Clearing (OnChange)
- Errors automatically clear when user starts typing/selecting
- Provides instant feedback that they're fixing the issue

### 4. Field Hints
Added helpful hints under each field:
```
Title: "Min 3 characters, max 100 characters"
Description: "Optional, max 500 characters"
Target Amount: "Min ₹100, Max ₹1,00,00,000"
Due Date: "Must be today or future date"
```

### 5. Better Placeholders
More descriptive placeholders to guide users:
```
Title: "e.g., Save for vacation, Emergency Fund"
Description: "e.g., Planning a family vacation to Goa in December"
Target Amount: "10000"
```

## Validation Rules

| Field | Required | Min | Max | Real-Time |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Title | ✅ | 3 char | 100 char | OnBlur |
| Description | ❌ | - | 500 char | OnBlur |
| Category | ✅ | - | - | OnChange |
| Target Amount | ✅ | ₹100 | ₹1,00,00,000 | OnBlur |
| Due Date | ✅ | Today | Future | OnBlur |

```

### After ✅

- Immediate field-specific feedback
- Clear, specific error messages
- Helpful hints and better placeholders
- Errors clear as user fixes them
```
